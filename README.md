ACTIVITY 3 – Profile & Settings Pages (UI Navigation Challenge)

🔹 Activity name
Profile and Settings Dashboard Interface

🔹 Description
This activity focuses on extending the NEONEX project by adding Profile and Settings pages to simulate a logged-in user experience. The goal is to demonstrate multi-page navigation, dashboard-style layout, and consistent UI design across the application.

This activity is UI-only and does not involve backend logic or database integration.

🔹 Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript

🔹 Features

Multi-page navigation flow (Landing → Login → Profile → Settings)
Dashboard-style profile layout with user information cards
Settings page with visual-only form inputs
Light/Dark mode preference toggle (Dark mode as default)
Theme preference persistence across pages using localStorage
Consistent futuristic NEONEX design across all pages
GitHub Pages–compatible navigation using relative links

🔹 AI Assistance Disclosure (Required)
Did you use AI tools? Yes

If YES, specify:
I used ChatGPT to assist with UI layout planning, navigation flow validation, theme toggle logic, and CSS refinements to ensure consistent styling across the Profile and Settings pages. All suggestions were reviewed, adapted, and customized by me to align with the project requirements and design goals.

🔹 Learning Reflection
Through this activity, I learned how to design and structure multi-page front-end interfaces while maintaining visual consistency and clean navigation. I also gained experience implementing user preference features such as light and dark mode using JavaScript and localStorage. The most challenging part was ensuring that design quality remained consistent across all pages while keeping the project fully front-end and GitHub Pages compatible.

🔹 Learning Reflection 
From this activity, I learned how to manage UI state changes using JavaScript and how to connect interactive components within a single-page layout. The most challenging part was ensuring smooth transitions and maintaining consistent styling between the login and sign-up views.
