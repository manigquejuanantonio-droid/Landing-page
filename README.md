🔹 Project Title

NEONEX – Futuristic Landing Page

🔹 Description

NEONEX is a conceptual, futuristic landing page for a next-generation social platform. It is designed to showcase a clean, immersive, and modern user interface inspired by cyberpunk aesthetics and advanced digital experiences. The project targets users interested in futuristic technology, digital identity, and social interaction in visually rich environments.

The landing page emphasizes strong visual impact, smooth micro-interactions, and a minimal yet engaging layout. It serves as a front-end demonstration of modern web design techniques, animation, and UI composition using standard web technologies.

🔹 Technologies Used

HTML5 – semantic structure and layout

CSS3 – animations, glassmorphism effects, neon styling, and responsive design

JavaScript (Vanilla) – interactive behavior, animations, and UI state control

🔹 Features

Futuristic hero section with animated neon text effects

Mouse-responsive parallax background movement

Cyberpunk-inspired glassmorphism UI elements

Modal-based login and sign-up interface (front-end only)

Smooth UI transitions and hover effects

Clean, responsive layout for desktop and mobile

Optimized for static hosting (GitHub Pages compatible)

🔹 AI Assistance Disclosure (Required)

Did you use AI tools? Yes

If YES, specify: I used ChatGPT to assist with UI layout ideas, CSS styling techniques, animation logic, interaction behavior, wording improvements, and general optimization guidance. All generated suggestions were reviewed, modified, and customized by me to align with my design vision and project requirements.

🔹 Learning Reflection

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of structuring a single-page landing experience while maintaining visual clarity and performance. I learned how to combine animations, effects, and interactivity without overwhelming the user or degrading performance.

The most challenging aspect was balancing futuristic visual effects—such as neon animations and background motion—while ensuring smooth performance, especially when deploying the project on GitHub Pages. This project helped reinforce best practices for front-end organization, performance awareness, and UI consistency.
